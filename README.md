# Transcriber Fullstack bot launcher and interactor and Discord Bot

For Palantir Launch Project!

Node.js server can be found in /backend

React code for frontend can be found in /frontend

Transcribe bot can be found /transcribe_bot

## Node.js instructions

1. npm install in both /frontend and /backend

2. put ur .env keys 

3. cd into /backend

4. npm run fullstack:dev

For discord bot, you would need to pull from a docker image, but I haven't made that public yet

## Transcribe Bot 

instructions can be found in /transcribe_bot

### NOTE:

For the transcribe bot, you need to create a /audio_segment directory, as git won't put it in its commit since i'm ignoring it

without it the bot will fail to create a .wav file, since it needs the directory to be present. Why it doesn't just make the directory is beyond me lol
